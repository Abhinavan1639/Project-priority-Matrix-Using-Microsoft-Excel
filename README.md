1. Purpose: The Project Priority Matrix is a tool designed for Atliq Hardware to prioritize projects based on predefined criteria, namely Feasibility, Impact, and Size.

2. Criteria Evaluation: Each project is assessed and assigned scores ranging from 1 to 10 for Feasibility, Impact, and Size, indicating the practicality, significance, and resource requirements of the projects, respectively.

3. Three Priority Levels: The matrix categorizes projects into three priority levels: High, Medium, and Low. Projects with high feasibility, significant impact, and substantial resource requirements fall under the High priority quadrant, while Medium and Low priority projects have a moderate or lower balance of these factors.

4. Resource Allocation and Sequencing: The Project Priority Matrix assists Atliq Hardware in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and project sequencing. It helps identify projects that align with company goals and have the potential to deliver significant value.

5. Effective Project Management: By utilizing the matrix, Atliq Hardware can prioritize projects effectively, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and projects are sequenced in a manner that maximizes their impact and feasibility. This enhances decision-making and optimizes project outcomes for the company.
